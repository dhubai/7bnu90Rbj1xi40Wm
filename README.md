# MonReader Page Flip Detection

## Project Overview

MonReader enhances document digitization with a mobile solution specifically designed to aid the blind, researchers, and anyone requiring efficient, bulk document scanning. This innovative tool simplifies the process by automating the detection of page flips from video frames, capturing high-resolution images for processing.

## Innovation and Technology

Using advanced artificial intelligence and computer vision technologies, MonReader detects when a page is flipped using just low-resolution camera previews. The system then processes these images to:
- Recognize and crop document corners accurately.
- Dewarp images for a flat document appearance.
- Enhance text contrast against backgrounds for clearer visibility.
- Preserve text formatting using machine learning.

## Achievements

Our solution has been developed to integrate seamlessly into existing data workflows, providing a tool that is not only cutting-edge but also highly accessible. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated, achieving an F1 score of 0.9715, indicating high accuracy in detecting page flips.

## Conclusion

MonReader represents a significant step forward in document digitization technology, offering a practical solution that meets the needs of a diverse user base. Its development is a testament to the potential of artificial intelligence to revolutionize everyday tasks and workflows.
